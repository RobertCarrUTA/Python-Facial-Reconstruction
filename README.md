# About
Utilized concepts from my linear algebra class to construct a facial reconstruction program in Python. Face reconstruction was achieved through the use of eigenfaces and principal component analysis. Based on a sample of 400 faces, the mean face of the sample was determined. I was able to reconstruct any face in the sample by adding the eigenfaces scaled by the weights to the mean face image.
