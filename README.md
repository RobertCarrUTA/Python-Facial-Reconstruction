## About
This Python project reconstructs faces from image datasets using Linear Algebra concepts. To reconstruct the face, the mean facial image of the dataset is computed (a dataset of 400 images), and then the eigenfaces are scaled by the weights and added to the mean facial image.

In addition to adding the Jupyter Notebook, I have also included the Python file. Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can view the results and reasoning behind code implementations very quickly.

*Unfortunately, the dataset is not available yet. I will make every effort to add it in the near future. The Jupyter Notebook will still show the results from the last run that still contained the dataset.*
